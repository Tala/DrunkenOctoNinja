====================
Running the Examples
====================

To run the examples you will need to set up DroneKit as described in :ref:`get-started` or the :ref:`quick-start`. 
Once you have the `source code <https://github.com/diydrones/dronekit-python/tree/master/example>`_, examples are 
started as described in the *Getting Started* section :ref:`getting-started-running_examples`.

.. note:: 

    If you're using a simulated vehicle, remember to disable the arming checks in *MAVProxy*
    (:ref:`see note here <disable-arming-checks>`).

The easiest way to get the DroneKit example source code is to clone the **dronekit-python** repo on your machine:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone http://github.com/diydrones/droneapi-python.git

The examples are stored in the subdirectories of **/dronekit-python/examples/**.
	


.. warning:: Propellers should be removed before testing examples indoors (on real vehicles).
