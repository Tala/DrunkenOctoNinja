# ParrotMinidroneControle
This Project is a mess :)

I'm trying to write an application, that can controle Parrot mini drones using BLE (bluetooth lower energy).
It's my first bluetooth project and I had to figure out lots of stuff (especially that BLE on Windows is a pain...)
I recently switcht to UWP 10, because it has the best support for the drones so far.
